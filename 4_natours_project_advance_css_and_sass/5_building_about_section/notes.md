# Create about with Think Build Architect principle

Image composition we are making maybe re-usable

As about section is unique to home we should put it in \_home.scss partial

- check base.scss for more on the text gradient style
  -check utilities classes. If we want to create a class just to center the text it is better to create a util class i.e u-center-text to center our inline elements

- Margins for our headers will differ so it is better to use another util class
