# principles of responsive design

## Main principles

- Fluid grids and layouts
  Use % rather then px for all layout related sizes (especially width!)

- Flexible/ responsive images
  They do not scale same as text or other content.
  We usually make them scale correctly by defining their dimensions and %
  Images make for the most MB size on our page so we need to create optimized images for diffrent sizes.

- Media queries
  for diffrent versions of website

## Layout types

There are 3 major ways of laying the layout:

1. Float layouts
   boxes put next to each other using floats

it is a old way of doing things. One huge advantage it is that it is very well supported

2. Flexbox

3. CSS grid
