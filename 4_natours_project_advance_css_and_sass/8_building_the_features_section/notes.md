<!-- Icons used will be from linea.io -->

pngs are worse practice then icopns as the do not scale nicely as icon fonts that are vectors

we will use lineafonts:
https://github.com/linea-io/Linea-Iconset

Best to include the fonts just before our custome styles

We want to style the section in the \_home direcotry as this section is unique tot his page

spaces between the fonts is best to style via utility classes
